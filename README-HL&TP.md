# Home Lab & Technical Projects

## Overview
This repository documents my ongoing personal home lab environment, built to gain hands-on experience with IT support fundamentals, server management, virtualization, networking, and web hosting.

The lab is designed for learning, experimentation, and troubleshooting — simulating real-world technical support scenarios in a controlled environment.

---

## Objectives
- Build practical IT support and troubleshooting skills
- Gain hands-on experience with operating systems, servers, and networked services
- Understand system configuration, maintenance, and basic security concepts
- Practice diagnosing and resolving service-level and connectivity issues

---

## Environment
- Mixed operating systems (Windows, Linux)
- Physical and virtual machines
- Local and cloud-integrated storage
- Self-hosted services and applications

---
